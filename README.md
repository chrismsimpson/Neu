# NeuMk19

You can find a prior work here: https://github.com/chrismsimpson/Neu

The older version is a stacked based interpreter of the language. This version is a C++ transpiler, meaning it can create Neu binaries (i.e. not an interpreter, not even a virtual machine), albiet with C++ as an intermediate representation.

You are taking your first steps...
